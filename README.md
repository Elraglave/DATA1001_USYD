## Project 1: Student Rental Market and International Student Cap
### Overview
This project investigates the impact of capping international students on Sydney's rental market, based on survey data from DATA1001/1901 students.

### Key Findings
- International students pay higher rents on average than domestic students but occupy fewer properties.
- Capping international student visas could reduce rental market pressure.
- Recommendation: Universities could repurpose unused buildings into affordable student housing.

### Data Summary
- **Source**: Survey of 533 students, Semester 2, 2024 cohort.
- **Cleaning**: Outliers removed (rents > $1100), omitted NA values for accuracy.

### Limitations
- Non-representative sample, potential bias from survey limitations.

## Project 2: Natural Disaster Impact and Economic Damage Analysis
### Overview
Analyzed data on global natural disasters (from Kaggle) to understand the correlation between population affected and economic damage, with a focus on supporting GFDRR in prioritizing disaster resilience efforts.

### Key Findings
- Moderate correlation (r = 0.512) between economic damages and affected populations.
- Asia is disproportionately impacted, particularly by floods, droughts, earthquakes, and storms.
- Recommendation: Prioritize disaster resilience efforts in Asia to mitigate both human and economic impacts.

### Methodology
- **Linear Regression**: Demonstrated significant correlation.
- **Map Visualization**: Highlighted high-impact regions for targeted interventions.

### Ethical Considerations
- Data privacy and transparency were upheld, with clear communication of limitations and findings.

### Acknowledgments
- GFDRR as the proposed client for their support in vulnerable regions.
